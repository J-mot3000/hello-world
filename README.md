# hello-world
This is my first repository that I have created as an intern at I.C.Stars. I am really excited because I know more now since creating my very first repo.

I am literally planning on changing my life path. I am on an exciting new journey! I can not wait until I am able to create code without having to look it up! Hopefully storing my practice projects here will help me? I do not know!
